* `make exec/curl` works for app-1 and app-2 but we can't route to app-3. Can you fix it?
* We seem to be updating the config map too often on Kubernetes, can you fix this?
* Add the ability to add an annotation to a service 'mesh-timeout: 2s' which will apply a timeout to requests on the server side (only the service affected should have its configuration modified)
